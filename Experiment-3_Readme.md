# EXP-3
## AIM: To study and implement operators and bitwise operators in C++

## THEORY: 
### 1. Understanding Basic Operators
Operators in C++ are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. The basic types include:
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
Increment and Decrement Operators: ++, --

### 2. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations. They include:
AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if one of the bits is 1.
XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.
NOT (~): Inverts all the bits.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions.

### 3. Theory Behind Bitwise Operations
Bitwise operations are performed directly on the binary representations of numbers. They are efficient and are often used in low-level programming, such as system programming, graphics, and cryptography.

Example
Consider two integers: a = 5 (binary 0101) and b = 3 (binary 0011).
AND (&): a & b results in 0001 (binary for 1).
OR (|): a | b results in 0111 (binary for 7).
XOR (^): a ^ b results in 0110 (binary for 6).
NOT (~a): ~a results in ...11111010 (binary representation in two's complement form, typically -6 in decimal if we are considering 8-bit integers).

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a, b, sum, diff, prod, div, mod, incr, decr;
    cout<<"Enter the value of a: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter the value of b: ";
    cin>>b;
    sum = a+b;
    cout<<"Sum of no.s is: "<<sum<<endl;
    diff = a-b;
    cout<<"Difference of no.s is: "<<diff<<endl;
    prod = a*b;
    cout<<"Product of no.s is: "<<prod<<endl;
    div = a/b;
    cout<<"Division of no.s is: "<<div<<endl;
    mod = a%b;
    cout<<"Modulus of no.s is: "<<mod<<endl;
    incr = ++a;
    cout<<"Increment of a is: "<<incr<<endl;
    decr = --b;
    cout<<"Decrement of b is: "<<decr<<endl;
    return 0;
}
